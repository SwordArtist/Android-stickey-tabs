As for yon-dan.\n
The process from Yondan to Godan involves polishing through further training what has been achieved so far. For Godan, one would have to have mastered all requirements for Shodan up to Yondan through long persistent training. While the requirements to be qualified as Godan are similar to that for Yondan, there is a certain variation in the order of priority. That is, ones\' quality as an instructor becomes more important. For instance, the following are the requirements for Godan in order of priority.\n
\n
Rational strike - in techniques, Godan should be able to utilise Shikake-waza, Oji-waza spontaneously in a match and should never miss opportunities to attack. One is also required to demonstrate a good footwork, manoeuvre well and good Z anshin after blows. Rational strikes are the highest state in Kendo technique one can achieve. There should be no unnecessary movements or strikes, it is a result of perfect balance, hit, techniques and spirit. Once one achieves this level of Kendo it becomes a beauty in its style and makes ones sense of the art in it.\n
\n
Kigurai - If one trains both physical and mental aspects of kendo and face opponents with a belief of winning rather than being possessed by winning, his or her Kendo will achieve high nobility.\n
\n
Qualifications as an instructor - as with yondan, quality as an instructor is important for Godan and it should be more refined.\n
\n
Correct attitude.\n
\n
Zanshin - Kensen must be \'alive\'. Kata - o-dachi 1-7, ko-dachi 1-3\n
